# Wallpaper Rotator

Multi-monitor wallpaper manager for Windows. Supports images and videos with per-monitor configuration and intuitive time-based rotation controls.

## Why This Project?

Existing wallpaper solutions often struggle with:
- **Frequent crashes** on Windows 11 24H2, especially with large wallpaper libraries
- **System instability** when locking/unlocking, changing display modes, or during fullscreen applications
- **Poor performance** with multi-monitor setups, taking minutes to launch and becoming unresponsive
- **Complexity** where simplicity is needed

Wallpaper Rotator was built to be **lightweight, stable, and crash-resistant** using a safe "No Injection" window strategy that avoids the issues plaguing other wallpaper applications on modern Windows versions.
